## Project Overview

The goal of the smart water bottle project is to create a device that can help users track their water intake and monitor the temperature of their water. The smart water bottle will be designed to hold hot and cold water, and will have sensors inside the cap to measure the water level, temperature, and weight. An algorithm will be designed to accurately measure the water level using either a pressure or ultrasonic sensor, and the sensors will be integrated into the smart water bottle cap. An intuitive interface will be developed to allow users to easily track their water intake, and the smart water bottle will be able to distinguish between pouring and drinking. The end result will be a convenient and useful device that can help users stay hydrated and healthy.

## Educational Value Added

The smart water bottle project provides several educational values, including learning about sensors, programming, and design. The project requires learners to select and integrate different types of sensors, such as pressure, temperature, and weight sensors, providing an opportunity to gain knowledge about how these sensors work and how to select the best sensor for a particular application. Additionally, learners will need to program the algorithm that accurately measures the water level, which can help them develop their programming skills. Finally, the project involves designing and creating a physical product, providing an opportunity to learn about design principles and manufacturing processes. Overall, the project combines several STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) disciplines and can provide a valuable learning experience for learners of all levels.
