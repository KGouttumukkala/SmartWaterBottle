# Summary
This project is to create a smart water bottle that can track water intake, measure the temperature of the water, and know when water was actually drank and when it was just poured out with the cap screwed off. The smart water bottle will have sensors inside the cap, including a pressure sensor or ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level, a temperature sensor to measure the temperature of the water, and a weight sensor to track water intake. The project will involve selecting the best sensors for the job, designing an algorithm to accurately measure the water level, and integrating the sensors into the smart water bottle. Additionally, the smart water bottle will be able to hold both hot and cold water, so the sensors must be able to work effectively in both temperature extremes. The end result will be a smart water bottle that allows users to easily track their water intake and monitor the temperature of their water, helping them stay hydrated and healthy.
